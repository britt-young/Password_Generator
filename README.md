# Secure Password Generator Web Application

## Easy to use, secure password generator with user-generated criteria

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security


## Installation

Accessible through web URL. No need to install the application.

## Usage

Upon site navigation, the user is presented with a blank text box and a "generate" button. The user clicks "generate" and is prompted with a series of password criteria;
- password length
- inclusion of uppercase letters
- inclusion of lowercase letters
- inclusion of numbers
- inclusion of special characters

Once the user has specified their criteria, the secure password will automatically be generated.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
